'''
alindromic Strings (Part 2)

Write another function that returns True if the string passed as an argument is a palindrome, or False otherwise. 
This time, however, your function should be case-insensitive, and should ignore all non-alphanumeric characters.
If you wish, you may simplify things by calling the is_palindrome function you wrote in the previous exercise.
